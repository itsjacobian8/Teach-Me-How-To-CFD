    "# TURBULENCE MODELLING\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "* To describe what turbulence is, it may help to start with the description of different flow regimes. Reynolds number which is a measure of the relative magnitudes of inertial and viscous forces is used to characterize flow regimes. Two critical Reynolds numbers can be defined to demarcate different flow regimes. Below the lowest critical Reynolds number (2300), flow is smooth and different layers of fluid slide past one another in an orderly manner. This regime is referred to as laminar flow. Above the lowest critical Reynolds, a series of events occur which allow transition from laminar to turbulent flow, with latter regime being realized above the second critical Reynolds number. The second critical Reynolds number can range from 4000 to 10000 depending on experimental conditions. Fluid flow in the turbulent regime can be described as chaotic and random. The velocity **u** in a turbulent flow can be divided into its mean value **U** and a fluctuating component **u'**.\n",

    "## Energy Cascade\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "* A turbulent flow consists of eddies of different sizes. An eddy eludes precise definition, but it can be regarded as a nearly coherent rotational flow structure. Large eddies interact and obtain their energy from the mean flow through a process known as vortex stretching, which requires velocity gradients in the mean flow and proper alignment of the eddies. Large eddies have characteristic Reynolds numbers on the order of mean flow Reynolds numbers and are therefore dominated by inertial effects. Eddies of intermediate size extract their energy from large eddies and small eddies feed on intermediate eddies in what is often referred to as the energy cascade. The energy of small eddies is dissipated as heat through the action of molecular viscosity. The rate of energy dissipation at the smallest scales is determined by the steady rate of energy transfer from the largest scales. The energy of the largest eddies is proportional to the square of their characteristic velocity $u_o^2$, and given that their characteristic time scale is $\\frac{l_o}{u_o}$, the steady rate of energy transfer to the smallest scales is $\\frac{u_o^2}{\\tau_o} = \\frac{u_o^3}{l_o}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "* The energy cascade was first described by Lewis F. Richardson and later quantified by Andriy Kolmogorov.\n",

    "## Kolmogorov Hypotheses\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "* After Richardson described the energy cascade, the following questions still needed to be answered:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. What is the size of the smallest eddies responsible for energy dissipation?\n",
    "    \n",
    "    2. As the turbulent length scale decreases, do the characteristic velocity $u\\left(l\\right)$ and time $\\tau\\left(l\\right)$ increase, decrease, or remain the same?\n",

    "* The assumption that Reynolds number decreases with $l$ is not sufficient to answer the second question.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Kolmogorov's Hypothesis on Local Isotropy\n",
    "\n",
    "* Large scale eddies tend to be anisotropic and sensitive to boundary conditions of the flows. Kolmogorov argued that the directional information is lost at intermediate and small scales. This was the essence of his local isotropy hypothesis, which states that at sufficiently high Reynolds numbers, small scale turbulent motions are statistically isotropic.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Kolmogorov introduced a length scale $l_{EI}$ to demarcate large anisotropic eddies from smaller isotropic eddies. The value of this new length scale is approximately a sixth of the characteristic length scale of the large anisotropic eddies ($l_{EI} \\approx \\frac{1}{6} l_o$).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Kolmogorov's First Similarity Hypothesis\n",
    "\n",
    "* This hypothesis is concerned with the parameters that control the behaviour of small scale turbulent motions that dissipate energy through the action of molecular viscosity. As mentioned, the energy dissipation rate at the small scales is determined by  steady rate of energy transfer from the largest scales. The turbulent motions at the smallest scales are also influenced by viscosity. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Kolmogorov's first similarity hypothesis then states that every small scale turbulent motion at sufficiently high Reynolds numbers has a universal form that is dependent on viscosity and the rate at which turbulent kinetic energy is dissipated $\\epsilon$.\n",

Away from the wall, the retarding effect slowly vanishes. A Reynolds number for such flows can be based on the length scale **L** in the flow direction. The value of this Reynolds number is on the order of $10^5$, implying that inertial effects are dominant. If we base the Reynolds number on the distance perpendicular to the flow or the distance from the wall **y**, the value of **y** would have to be on the order of **L** for inertial effects to dominate.\n",
