    "# POPULATION BALANCE MODELLING\n",

    "* Euler-Euler and Euler-Lagrange approach can be used to model the behaviour of multiphase flows. Euler-Lagrange approach tends to capture the interactions and coupling between the continuous phase and the dispersed phase(s). On the other hand, Euler-Euler approach treats the continuous phase and dispersed phase as a set of interprenetrating continua with a shared pressure field. Euler-Euler approach has demonstrated relative success in simulating monodisperse multiphase flows, but to close some of the gap to Euler-Lagrange approach, it needs to be coupled with a population balance model. The population balance model is a transport equation for particle number density. Particles can collide, break and/or coalesce/aggregate. Here, the term \"particle\" has been used loosely to refer to a solid particle, a bubble  and a droplet. The balance equation can simply be stated as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "    $$\\text{rate of change} + \\text{transport by advection} + \\text{growth rate} = \\text{birth by breakage} - \\text{death by breakage} + \\text{birth by aggregation} - \\text{death by aggregation}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "* We will use $n_i \\left(\\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{r}, t\\right)$ to represent the number density function, where $\\mathbf{x}$ represents the physical space (external cordinate) occupied by the continuous phase, $\\mathbf{r}$ the abstract space (internal cordinate) within which particle properties are found and $t$ time. We will also use $\\mathbf{V}_{\\mathbf{x}}$ and $\\mathbf{V}_{\\mathbf{r}}$ to represent the velocity through physical and abstract space, respectively. With these definitions, the preceding equation can mathematically be expressed as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "    $$\\frac{\\partial n_i}{\\partial t} + \\nabla_{\\mathbf{x}} \\cdot \\left(\\mathbf{V}_{\\mathbf{x}} n_i\\right) + \\nabla_{\\mathbf{r}} \\cdot \\left(\\mathbf{V}_{\\mathbf{r}} n_i\\right) = S_{\\text{birth, breakage}} - S_{\\text{death, breakage}} + S_{\\text{birth, aggregation}} - S_{\\text{death, aggregation}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "* Where:\n",
    "\n",
    "    $$S_{\\text{birth, breakage}} = \\int_{\\Omega_v} p g\\left(V^{\\dagger}\\right) \\beta\\left(V|V^{\\dagger}\\right) n_i\\left(V^{\\dagger}, t\\right) dV^{\\dagger}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "    $$S_{\\text{death, breakage}} = g\\left(V\\right) n_i \\left(V,t\\right)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "    $$S_{\\text{birth, aggregation}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_0^V a\\left(V - V^{\\dagger}, V^{\\dagger}\\right) n_i\\left(V - V^{\\dagger}, t\\right) n_i\\left(V^{\\dagger}, t\\right)dV^{\\dagger}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "    $$S_{\\text{death, aggregation}} = \\int_0^{\\infty} a\\left(V, V^{\\dagger}\\right) n_i\\left(V, t\\right) n_i\\left(V^{\\dagger}, t\\right)dV^{\\dagger}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "* Closure relations are required to specify $g\\left(V^{\\dagger}\\right)$ and $\\beta\\left(V|V^{\\dagger}\\right)$. The former is the breakage frequency and the latter is the probability of a particle of volume $V^{\\dagger}$ breaking up to form a particle of volume $V$. Notable examples of breakage frequency models include those proposed by Luo and Lehr. Any probability distribution model can be used to specify $\\beta\\left(V|V^{\\dagger}\\right)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The aggregation kernel $a\\left(V, V^{\\dagger}\\right)$ needs to also be specified via closure model. The first step in aggregation dynamics is the approach and collision of particles. A frequency of collision can be specified for this first step. It is important to note that not all collisions lead to coalescence. The success of collisions can be quantified using collision efficiency, which is essentially the probability of particles of volume $V$ coalescing with particles of volume $V^{\\dagger}$. A few examples of aggregation kernel include constant, Luo, free molecular and turbulent models.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The preceding approach is often referred to as the method of classes and requires the particle size distribution to be represented as a finite number of size groups. In this approach, the number of equations to be solved is proportional to the number of size groups formed from the particle size distribution. The selection of number of size groups is crucial to properly represent the underlying distribution, but an excessively high number of size groups comes at the expense of computational efficiency. The total number of particles in each size group is computed. The volume fraction of each size group can then be computed by multiplying the group's mean particle volume with the total number of particles in the group. The overall volume fraction in a cell is then obtained by summing up individual volume fractions. To ensure the overall volume fraction is between 0 and 1, the continuity equation is solved, with the solution of the population balance model used to distribute the volume fraction among different size groups via $f_i$. \n",

    "* Alternative approaches have been proposed to lower the computational cost. One of these approaches include the standard method of moments, which uses a few low order moments to represent the particle size distribution, rendering it more computationally efficient. Using particle volume $V_p$ to represent the internal cordinate, the $k^{th}$ moment can be determined as follows:\n",
