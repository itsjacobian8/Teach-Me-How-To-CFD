    "*  Having discussed various discretization schemes, at this point it may seem trivial solving the above set of equations. And while the momentum equations are non-linear due to the dependence of advection coefficients $\\rho u$ on the dependent variable $u$, which we are trying to solve for, the main challenge is the pressure term. Nonlinearity can easily be handled by employing an iterative solution procedure. On the other hand, both pressure and velocity fields are unknown a priori.\n",
    "\n",
    "* One may ask why pressure cannot be specified through an equation of state via the density which can be solved for through the continuity equation or better yet eliminate it entirely through the stream function-vorticity formulation, which was presented in one of the notebooks. The former is only possible for compressible flows and does not work for incompressible flows. There are a few concerns about adopting the latter approach:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    1. It is not always desirable to eliminate pressure since it is an important variable. There are ways to calculate pressure from solution obtained via the vorticity method, but this requires significant computational effort which may offset the gains realized from eliminating pressure in the first place.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    2. Vorticity is difficult to specify at a wall and an arbitrary value can cause convergence issues.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    3. The main concern is that the vorticity method cannot be extended to 3-D problems for which a stream function does not exist. For 3-D problems, vorticity formulation results in 6 dependent variables, including 3 vorticity components and 3 velocity components. This is in contrast to the pressure-velocity formulation which has 4 dependent variables only (3 velocity components, 1 pressure variable). \n",

    "* Since the stream function-vorticity method is undesirable, we need to couple the continuity and momentum equations somehow. One difficulty with this exercise is how to treat the first derivatives of pressure and velocity. As shown elsewhere, the central difference scheme was found to be sufficient for second derivatives that show up in the diffusion term. However, use of central difference for the first derivatives found in the advection term was shown to be oblivious to the state of node P. Alternative schemes that recognize the unidirectional nature of advection were proposed. Although not made explicit, the velocity components were specified at the cell face, while the advected property $\\phi$ was specified at the nodes, with their cell face values determined through interpolation. A similar treatment can be employed here in specifying the velocity components and pressure variable on a grid. This type of specification where the pressure is located at the centers of the control volumes and velocities at the boundaries of the control volumes is often referred to as a staggered grid. This specification does require a computer program that can keep track of geometric locations of the velocities and perform interpolations.\n",
